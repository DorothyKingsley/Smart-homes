hid : house identifier - we ideally dont need it, because it is a test bed
uid : identifier of the component that created this document. Could be an IPv6 address, a
MAC address, or a name. - possibly drop it
bt - datetime needs to converted to date and time column separately
ts- drop this 
e- this is the main. parse e to get the values of the keyword recordings like BMP_TEMP,HDC_TEMP.
    make the columns BMP_TEMP,HDC_TEMP, PIR_TRIGS, BMP_PRES
    PIR_TRIGS - get the value parsed for 'v' list of 1s and 0s
    
File ENV_RAW_MON_ROOMS.bson
e- RSSI values parse those into signal strengths for wearables.
bt - get the date and time in separate fields

File : Wear.bson
what does one coordinate difference mean?
understand the coordinates? where is center for the accelerometer?
mc field in gw array - sequence no. of gateway field -- ignore
mc outside - sequence no. of the wearable that generated the data -- ignore

File : SPHERE_RAW_MON_PYTHON.bson
Might need the below fields: Parse from data[2510:2700] 17:40 - 19:1
bt - get the date time in separate fields.
u'RSSI' - signal strength of accelerometer
u'LOCATION' - to get the location // {u'n': u'LOCATION', u'v': u'bedroom 2'}
